# Sketch-to-Face-using-Multi-GANs

The project involves converting a sketch image to a real life face like image using a series of GANs (Generative Adversarial Network) models. 
Contextual GANs, GFPGANs and DeOldify were used to implement our model which was hosted over Anvil server. 

## Step 1

Contextual GANs model. Training the model. We referred to _________ for their approach on text to face as layer 1. 

## Step 2

Save model as h5 file. We have a very partially trained model on the given drive link. 

## Step 3

Fire up the colab notebook. Run all imports and installations including accessing h5 model from google drive.

## Step 4

Alterations in the notebook. gfpgan_inference.py file present in the GFPGANs folder after github pull command needs to be edited. The replacement of the specific code is provided towards the end in the colab notebook. 

## Step 5

Open Anvil. Link to colab notebook . Tutorial link which helped me ____.
